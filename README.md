# MineSweeper

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 7.0.0-rc.2.


Please first run ‘npm install’ to download all the dependency.


## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/` and check the running app. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

Two tests will fail as I did not get a chance to finish them. Both tests have explanation of what still needs to be done.

These tests can be found in the file:
 
src/app/components/masthead/masthead.component.spec.ts

Majority of the other tests are blank and only satisfy the dependencies to make tests compile and run.

The only test that currently produces any real testing is 
src/app/models/mine-map-util.spec.ts

The unit test minimally tests the algorithm of creating a mine map with randomly placed mines and generated counts for the spaces adjacent to the mines.
